Introduction to GitHub

Getting familiar with the GH development environment.  I plan to try some software devemopment here using some languages that I am not familiar with - SQL, Java, Javascript.  I am a realtime embedded developer raised on C/C++ and TI assembly.  I'm also experienced in Tcl/Tk, Python, & Matlab.

Looking forward to using GH.
